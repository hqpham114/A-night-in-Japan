Tokyo is one of the most exciting cities on Earth, and has a legendary nightlife.

You can begin your evening at a tachinomi stand bar, drink and dine at a cozy izakaya, enjoy seasonal cocktails at an only-in-Tokyo mixology counter, venture into a hole-in-the-wall rock or hip hop club, sing all-night karaoke à la Bill Murray in Lost in Translation, and dance until morning to the beats of DJs from around the world.

In short, Tokyo is home to one of the most diverse and fascinating nightlife scenes on the planet! In such a massive metropolis, and with so many amazing options, trying to decide what to do can be overwhelming (for daytime tips, make sure to see our One Day in Tokyo).

So to help you figure out where to begin, before you see where the night takes you, we’ve put together this introductory guide to Tokyo nightlife, featuring an overview of Tokyo’s best nightlife districts and more!

Of course, with a complex and ever-changing nightlife scene, this is only a small sampling of what’s out there – and many of the best spots are firmly off the radar of most travelers (and even locals), with some venues even lacking addresses. But we hope our guide helps inspire you to venture out into the neon-filled streets, and discover for yourself what makes Tokyo’s nightlife so spectacular!
