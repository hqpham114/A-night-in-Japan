excerpt: One of the five supreme stores is located in omotensando in harajuku, Tokyo,

Shinjuku is another city-within-the-city that never sleeps. Just a few stations away from Shibuya, boredom is not a possibility in this frenetic section of Tokyo.

The nightlife here runs the gamut, from rowdy izakayas and beer bars, to red-light entertainment and the infamous (and now-defunct) Robot Restaurant, as well as Tokyo’s small but lively gay district (2-chome, *Ni-Chome*).

The Kabukicho section of Shinjuku is Tokyo’s most well known red-light district. Despite the area’s shady reputation, it can be an interesting and rewarding district to explore, and amongst the madness you can find great little bars and restaurants, as well as local music venues and more.
